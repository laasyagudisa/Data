EPA creates air quality trends using measurements from monitors located across the country.The table below show that air quality based on concentrations of the common pollutants has improved nationally since 1980. EPA estimates nationwide emissions of ambient air pollutants and the pollutants they are formed from (their precursors).These estimates are based on actual monitored readings or engineering calculations of the amounts and types of pollutants emitted by vehicles, factories, and other sources.Emission estimates are based on many factors, including levels of industrial activity, technological developments, fuel consumption, vehicle miles traveled, and other activities that cause air pollution. Emissions information is developed with input from state and local air agencies, tribes, and industry.  EPA tracks a range of emissions data, including how much of each pollutant is emitted from various pollution sources.  To view national, state, and local emissions summary data, see EPA’s Air Emissions Sources site.The table below shows that emissions of the common air pollutants and their precursors have been reduced substantially since 1980. *As a result of the permanent phase-out of leaded gasoline, controls on emissions of lead compounds through EPA’s air toxics program, and other national and state regulations, airborne lead concentrations in the U.S. decreased 98 percent between 1980 and 2005.After 2005, the EPA methodology for lead changed and is not comparable to the 2005 and earlier numbers.Since 2008, emissions have continued to decrease by 30 percent from 2008 to 2017.In the 2017 NEI, the highest amounts of Pb emissions are from Piston Engine Aircrafts, and Ferrous and Non-ferrous Metals industrial sources.The 2008 and 2017 estimates were used to approximate the 2010 to 2022 percent change. Emissions of air pollutants continue to play an important role in a number of air quality issues.In 2022, about 66 million tons of pollution were emitted into the atmosphere in the United States.These emissions mostly contribute to the formation of ozone and particles, the deposition of acids, and visibility impairment.To get detailed information about emissions estimates displayed below, please visit EPA's Air Pollutant Emissions Trends Data. Annual emissions estimates are used as one indicator of the effectiveness of our programs.The graph below shows that between 1980 and 2022, gross domestic product increased 196 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 108 percent, energy consumption increased 29 percent, and U.S. population grew by 47 percent.During the same time period, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 73 percent.The graph also shows that CO2 emissions, after having risen gradually for decades, have shown an overall decrease since 2007, and in 2021 were 7 percent higher than 1980 levels. Note: CO2 emissions estimate through 2021 (Source: US Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report)          Gross Domestic Product: Bureau of Economic Analysis          Vehicle Miles Traveled: Federal Highway Administration          Population: Census Bureau          Energy Consumption: Dept. of Energy, Energy Information Administration          Aggregate Emissions: EPA's Air Pollutant Emissions Trends Data   Comparison of Growth Areas and Emissions, 1970-2022 (png)  Despite great progress in air quality improvement, approximately 85 million people nationwide lived in counties with pollution levels above the primary NAAQS in 2022.  In addition, from 1990 to 2017 emissions of air toxics declined by 74 percent, largely driven by federal and state implementation of stationary and mobile source regulations. In recent years, EPA has acted to dramatically improve America's air quality by designing and developing national programs that, when fully implemented, will achieve significant reductions in air emissions.The associated air quality benefits will lead to improved health, longevity, and quality of life for all Americans. Weather conditions influence emissions and air quality.  EPA has developed statistical approaches to account for weather’s influence on ozone and fine particles.  While these approaches do not change the quality of air we breathe, they do help us understand how well emission reduction programs are working. More information is available for trends in ozone adjusted for weather conditions. 
We hear the phrase sustainable living—or iterations of it, such as sustainable shopping or zero waste living—thrown around a lot, nowhere more so than here at Sustainable Jungle.  But what does that phrase actually mean?Just what is sustainable livingand how can we adopt its principles in a way that’s both practical and impactful? First, realize that there is no absolute sustainable living definition; it means different things to different people, but in an overall nutshell, living sustainably means minimizing your use of Earth’s resources and reducing the damage of human and environmental interactions.  You can think of it as reducing your carbon footprint—but it goes far beyond that. Let’s look deeper. In complex terms, living in a sustainable way refers to a practical philosophy that aims to reduce personal and societal environmental impact to net zero by making positive changes which counteract climate change and other negative environmental concerns. If all that sounds like waffle, more simply, sustainable living is about returning to the earth whatever you take from it.It aims to achieve an environmental equilibrium.This is sometimes called “net zero living” or striking a “zero energy balance” with the Earth.  Obviously, this is sustainability in its ideal form, and is virtually impossible for anyone to truly achieve.  So, instead of focusing on perfection, sustainable living practices focus on f reducing one’s carbon footprint.  If you need motivation to jump on board, figure out yours using the World Wildlife Fund’s environmental footprint calculator.  But try as you might, nobody will ever be able to completely stamp out their carbon footprint.Hence, sustainability needs to be viewed in practical terms, which means we should all be taking small steps to consume earth’s resources consciously. Disclaimer:There is no perfect picture of “sustainability”, nor is there one fixed achievement or end goal.It’s about doing what YOU can within your means.  Fortunately, there are lots of different strategies, actions, and lifestyle tweaks that together make up a much more sustainable way of living.Not all of them may work for you, and that’s okay!Start with what you can do today, and build momentum as you get more comfortable. Because the more each individual implements even the smallest changes in their lives, the greater the impact we will collectively have.   Here are some of the most impactful and practical examples of living sustainably: One of the easiest ways to live more sustainably is by, well, telling others what it means to live sustainably. You can use your voice either directly through raising awareness and standing up for change or indirectly through making sure what you spend your money on really counts. So as a precursor to the rest of this section, the most important thing you can do is to vote for those challenging the status quo.Demand better from our leaders in power (they are the ones with the capacity to make big change, after all) and vote with your dollar by supporting brands making a difference.  Because the reality is—as much as we hate that it’s so—your dollar (and lack of your dollar for that matter!)speaks far more loudly to Big Business than your voice ever can. Consuming less stuff more thoughtfully will go a long way in your sustainable lifestyle.After all, sustainable living ultimately comes down to the 5 R’s. Being more minimalist and buying less reduces waste on behalf of the consumer and reduces industry emissions by the manufacturer.Adopt a “need over want” mindset.  If you do need something, buy second hand first!Go thrifting, hit up garage sales, or scour Facebook marketplace.For instance, if you want to support sustainable fashion, but well-made timeless pieces that will last and support circularity by shopping online thrift stores or using clothing rental services. Action:Anytime you feel inclined to buy something, ask yourself, “Do I REALLY need this?How much will I use it?Do I have something at home that would work or I could adapt to work for what I need?Could I borrow this from someone?Would this be easy to find second hand?” Sustainable living says “no” to fossil fuels (and not just because we’re running out of them).Their extraction not only destroys the planet, but they burn dirty, releasing tons of CO2 emissions.  Renewable energy on the other hand includes energy derived from unlimited sources (i.e. sun, wind, water, geothermal, and biomass) that are clean to use.The benefits of renewable energy, both environmentally and economically, make it one of the biggest sustainable living solutions. Action: Research renewable energy providers in your country/city and make the switch for your home energy.If that’s not practically or financially possible for you, buy from brands who use renewables when you can. To a large extent, organic food is grown without the use of chemical pesticides and herbicides.It’s not only better for you but MUCH better for the environment.   In fact, chemicals used by inorganic farming is one of the leading causes of biodiversity loss.The Bugs Matter monitoring scheme revealed a 64% reduction in flying insects in 18 years in the UK alone.Further reduction will lead to a food chain catastrophe. What is regenerative agriculture though? It’s a method of organic farming that focuses on improving soil health, sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, while also improving crop productivity.  Project Drawdown lists Regenerative Agriculture as the 11th most impactful solution for drawing down carbon (slowing and ultimately reversing climate change).  Action: Purchase from farmers that use organic and regenerative methods.You can often find them at local farmers markets and many now have online stores.Yes, these often cost a bit more, but if it’s within your means, investing in sustainable food systems is one of the smartest things you can do. And there’s no way to better support organic agriculture than adopting its principles yourself.Besides, anyone who has successfully grown their own tomato knows the satisfaction of making something from just about nothing and the taste is oh so good! Growing your own food using organic methods not only greens urban spaces but also sequesters carbon, makes cities greener, increases biodiversity, and reduces food travel miles. In that vein, we’ve seen a recent surge of urban farming efforts, and a push to keep food grown locally, organically, and without excess: the trifecta of sustainable food. Self sufficiency can go the extra mile when we consider what we feed our homes too, and going off-grid is a great option.Self-sustaining homes are independent of fossil fuels or mainstream non-renewable energy sources.Instead they make use of naturally collected rainwater, composting toilets, and wood burning heat.  Not to mention keeping produce fresh and preserving food to reduce food waste. Action: If you’re new to gardening, start small and follow our ecological gardening tips.If you’re really limited on space, see if there are any community gardens in your area where you can rent a plot.This is a great way to get your green thumb wet, with many of the materials and space provided for you. Farming methods aside, adopting a plant rich diet is an incredibly impactful way to live more sustainably. Research shows vegan diets result in 75% less climate-heating emissions, water pollution, and land use than diets in which more than 100g of meat a day was eaten.Vegan diets also cut the destruction of wildlife by 66% and water use by 54%, the study found. The meat and dairy industry takes up 83% of all farmland and is responsible for 60% of the agricultural industry’s 13.7 billion tons of yearly emissions. The Vegan Calculator suggests that adopting a plant-based diet can save 401,500 gallons of water, 10,950 square feet of forest, and 7,300 pounds of CO2 emissions per person per year—not to mention the 365 animal lives saved. Numerous studies, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council’s report “Less Beef, Less Carbon”, all echo the same truth: meat, at least the way it is farmed today, is unsustainable and inhumane. Action: Opt for plant-based where possible.Rest assured you don’t have to switch to an entirely vegan diet to make a difference.Consider simply eating less meat.Perhaps try Meatless Mondays, weekday veganism/vegetarianism, or a flexitarian diet. Food waste is the most ridiculous problem facing humanity and could be so easily solved. Project Drawdown lists reducing food waste as the #3 most impactful solution to reducing carbon.Food is currently wasted all the way along the supply chain and it is extremely destructive in landfill, making up 8% of all emissions.  In America alone, people throw away 60 million tons of food every year, which is shocking when you consider most food is compostable.  Rather than send them to the landfill where they’ll decompose anaerobically and produce methane gas (the most powerful of the greenhouse gasses), turn your food waste into something beneficial for the planet.  Space is no excuse: you can even compost in an apartment.  Action:Better planning can massively reduce food waste in the home alongside preserving and freezing food, finding creative ways of using food scraps, composting and growing your own food.  Sustainable living seeks to replace gas-guzzling, high horsepower vehicles with fuel-efficient, hybrid, or electric cars.  But we recognize the ability to afford such vehicles is a privilege, and sustainable transportation shouldn’t be reserved for only those who can afford it, nor should folks be shamed for driving their old gas guzzler they’re determined to keep alive.After all, making things last is sustainable in its own right. Fortunately, there are much more cost effective methods to reduce your transportation impact.Action: Simply drive less where possible, whether through active commutes (cycling or walking) or, if your commute is too long, public transportation (trains and buses run whether you are on them or not) and carpooling.  Shopping local rather than ordering online or buying from big box stores will cut your carbon footprint.  Consider how far something must be shipped before you support it.By buying locally, you’re not only supporting your local economy and smaller businesses, but you’re casting a vote against a world practically choking on shipping emissions.  If you do buy online, support ethical online alternatives. Action:Check out your local farmer’s market and get to know the local growers in your area.For gifts and things, craft fairs and art walks are another excellent way to see where you can stock up on locally handmade artisan goods. Sustainability and zero waste may be trending, but sustainable living must become the status quo.It’s a necessary lifestyle ethos that should become the default if we want to preserve the planet for future generations.   Climate change is happening.Resource depletion and biodiversity loss are happening.And we’re not just running out of unnecessary fossil fuels, but out of things like fresh water, which every single person and lifeform on the planet needs to survive.   The term itself denotes its own importance.Sustainable living: a means of sustaining life on this planet. If you’re reading this article, you’ve already made a huge step in the right direction.  From here, take baby steps.Rather than setting your sights immediately on profound world-shattering changes, focus on what you can do TODAY to reduce your impact.Then think about what you can do tomorrow and keep going from there. If you need more sustainable living ideas than the actions we’ve provided here, check out our list of 101 sustainability tips on reducing your impact with little to no effort. No one expects you to start living off-grid immediately (or ever, really, because that’s just not realistic for most people!).Small steps in the right direction will take you far.

March 18, 2023 Hailey Carrillo What do we mean when we say sustainable living? The basic definition of sustainability is the ability to maintain or support a process continuously over time. In the context of environmentalism, sustainability refers to any efforts to reduce personal and societal environmental impact through positive lifestyle change—and there’s no one correct way to implement those changes.  For some, sustainability might translate to consuming as little as possible, for others it might mean striving for a zero waste lifestyle.Although related, low waste living is just a small subset under the sustainable living umbrella which you can pursue by adopting any zero waste tips into your daily routine and buying habits. But broadly speaking, living sustainably means much more than just consuming less and because it means different things to different people, it’s important to decide what sustainable living means to you.  Yes, this will mean adopting some lifestyle changes (big or small or both, it’s up to you) but it doesn’t have to be hard.Sustainable solutions are now easier than ever to incorporate into your life. That’s why we gathered an extensive list of sustainability tips and ideas we hope will inspire you to make sustainable changes to your lifestyle. First, why is it important that people start implementing some of these tips for sustainable living into their lives? It takes a lot to keep the human population going.  According to the United Nations, the world population has officially reached 8 billion people, and it’s projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050.Should this occur, the equivalent of almost three planets would be needed to provide the natural resources to maintain the current lifestyle of the human population.  The problem is, we don’t have three Earths.We have one.  The human population relies on both finite, non-renewable resources and “infinite” renewable resources to survive.  We use quotations because, in theory, renewable resources are infinite, but provide a finite amount of resources through a given period of time.The Global Footprint Network estimates we are using these resources at almost twice the rate that Earth can renew them.  Our natural resources have already been depleted at alarming (and ever-growing) rates that are not sustainable because not-too-distant future generations will not be able to maintain them. To make matters worse, while we are consuming, we are also polluting.  According to the EPA, 67 million tons of pollution were emitted into the atmosphere by the United States alone in 2021.Air pollution is one of the largest human health concerns we are facing today.Exposure to high levels of pollution can increase the risk of respiratory infection, heart disease, lung cancer, and the subsequent death of 7 million people per year.  Waterways are being clogged with chemical and physical contaminants, too.Every day, 2 million tons of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste are discharged into our water system.Not only is this depleting our own water quality, but it’s also killing millions of species who rely on these precious water sources. We are in the midst of what scientists call the sixth mass extinction, with extinction rates estimated to be 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than natural ones.Unlike previous extinctions, the current one is being caused solely by human activity.  Our current consumption and pollution patterns are causing intense (and potentially irreversible) environmental degradation concerns like climate change, water pollution, air pollution, and biodiversity loss.  We are the sole cause of our environmental problems, and we are the sole solution.  If everyone adopts just some sustainable lifestyle tips now (which in turn will force changes by the larger corporations responsible for 71% of global emissions), we can collectively halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. With sustainable living, small actions equal big change, and the time for action is now. 1. Save energy with energy efficient lighting.Compact fluorescent bulbs use around 20% of the energy to produce the same amount of light as an incandescent bulb and can last up to 10 times as long, meaning this is one of the most impactful home sustainability tips.  2. Reduce “phantom drain” energy consumption.Studies show that 35% of residential energy used is wasted.Save energy by turning off lights and unplugging appliances (even eco-friendly chargers) when not in use.Of all easy sustainability tips at home, this one has perhaps the biggest potential to reduce your carbon footprint. 3. Utilize solar energy.While installing solar panels in your house has a high upfront cost, it minimizes your use of electricity to save money in the long run—$130 per month for the average homeowner!  4.Shop second hand for furniture (or recycled options like recycled outdoor plastic furniture).Not only will you save space in the landfill, but you can also curate a more unique, sustainable interior design. 5. Set up a water catchment system.A rain barrel can collect rainwater, which can be used to water plants or wash your car.  6.Air dry your clothes.Not only is hang-drying environmentally friendly, but it will also save you 24 and 72 cents per hour you would otherwise use the dryer, depending on the model.. 7.Start an apartment garden.Houseplants not only consume CO2, but can help purify the air by removing harmful chemicals for a healthier, more sustainable home.  8. Insulate your home properly.A properly insulated house will help your home stay cool in summer and warm in winter, meaning you won’t have to crank up the heating or air conditioning unit.This doesn’t have to involve a big remodel.Something as simple as adding thermal curtains or draft-stopper to your doors can make a big difference. 9. Switch to water-based paints when renovating.Oil paints have harmful chemicals that can leak into the watershed and pollute the waterways.Make sure they’re low-VOC, too, to prevent dangerous off-gassing of chemicals that degrade the air quality in your home. 10. Consider going meat-free.Studies show that a plant-based diet can reduce food’s carbon footprint by 73%.Adopting a vegan and cruelty-free lifestyle (or even just reducing your meat consumption) reduces energy consumption, supports clean waterways, and reduces the pressure on overfished oceans.  11.Support sustainable food systems and learn what foods are sustainable.If giving up meat is a no-go for you, you can still make that steak more sustainable by sourcing it locally from organic, grass-fed farms. 12. Visit local farmer’s markets.Locally-sourced produce travels about 27 times less distance than conventionally sourced produce.By reducing the need to transport and store food, your plate will have a smaller carbon footprint.Local often means organic food that’s cultivated in-season, meaning you’re not supporting industrial-scale agriculture to produce crops unnaturally. 13.Ditch the take-away.Plastic and styrofoam take-away containers dominate ocean plastic waste.Unfortunately, waste is almost unavoidable when ordering take-away, so it is almost always better to dine-in.  14.Invest in plastic-free food storage containers.Things like silicone sandwich bags and knowing how to use beeswax wraps can replace the need for single-use plastic wrap, which is difficult to recycle and picks up harmful chemicals. 15.Switch to bamboo eco-friendly dinnerware.Bamboo has a smaller carbon footprint than wood or steel due to its rapid growth rate, carbon sequestration, and regeneration ability.It also happens to be durable and stylish. 16. Set up a compost system.This is hands-down one of the best sustainability practices you can implement.An indoor compost bin helps reduce food waste (which otherwise releases devastating methane gas in landfills) and turns your food scraps into natural fertilizer for plants. 17.While paper towels are compostable, ditch them for reusable paper towels, Swedish dishcloths, or old t-shirts.  18.Use the dishwasher.Unintuitive though it may sound, dishwashers actually save water (up to 5,000 gallons a year with an efficient appliance).That at least makes everyone’s least favorite chore a bit better, especially when using eco-friendly dishwasher tablets.  19.Speaking of, invest in energy efficient appliances.The EPA gives the ENERGY STAR label to eco-friendly appliances when they meet energy efficiency specifications, making it easy to decide what appliances are the most efficient.  20.Switch to zero waste coffee products.Make that life-giving nectar even better by investing in reusable mesh filters or reusable coffee cup pods rather than plastic or paper versions.  21.Install a tap filter to purify water.80% of the plastic bottles purchased in the U.S. end up in landfills, a number that can be easily reduced by drinking filtered tap water instead. 22.Ditch the plastic straws.Plastic straws are among the top ten contributors to plastic marine debris around the world (and we’ve all seen that video of the turtle with a straw stuck in its nose.) 23.Tackle waste using the 5 Rs of zero waste.These are: reduce, refuse, reuse, recycle, and rot.Learning how to properly dispose of your waste can minimize the amount of product getting sent to landfills. 24.Use eco-friendly cleaning products.More sustainable home living means making sure our cleaners are clean in every way.Most surface disinfects use toxic chemicals that are slow to biodegrade, threaten wildlife, and are toxic to you. 25.Swap plastic bottles for glass bottles.Glass spray bottles last longer, meaning you can use them over and over for all your favorite refillable cleaning products. 26.Stick to natural, DIY cleaners when possible.Baking soda and lemon juice are cheap natural cleaners that can be used on a variety of surfaces.  27.Use recycled garbage bags or biodegradable trash bags.While still imperfect, they’re better than virgin plastic bags that take 1,000 years for a plastic bag to degrade in a landfill.  28.Wash with cold water.About 90% of the energy the washing machine uses goes towards heating the water.Washing your clothes with cold water saves energy and reduces wrinkles, fading, and wear and tear on your clothing. 29.Invest in a microfiber catching wash bag.An average of 9 million microfibers are released into wastewater treatment plants every time we launder garments made of synthetic fabrics.Most laundry machines do not have a microfiber filter and wastewater treatment plants have a hard time filtering them, meaning most of the time they end up in the ocean, in fish, and eventually, in humans. 30.Reduce waste water and water consumption.We know you’ve been waiting for this one, but take shorter showers.Or don’t flush the toilet every time you use it, which saves anywhere from 2-7 gallons per flush.These almost-effortless daily sustainability tips will save literal tons of water over a lifetime. 31.Invest in a low-flow toilet.If not flushing is too gross for you, low-flow toilets may be the way to go (to the bathroom).They use ~1.28 gallons of water per flush while inefficient, older toilets can use up to seven.  32.Switch to eco-friendly shampoo and conditioner.In the United States alone, 550 million empty shampoo bottles are thrown away every year.This statistic does not include conditioner or soap bottles.Bottle alternatives help reduce this number, while opting for cleaner ingredients reduces the waterway pollution caused by synthetic soaps.  33.Use zero waste toothpaste tablets.They can be easily bought in bulk and stored in plastic-free containers (and you won’t have to spend hours getting the last drop of toothpaste out of the tube.)  34.Brush with bamboo.Plastic toothbrushes can take up to 500 years to decompose while a zero waste toothbrush made of bamboo is naturally compostable (though you may need to remove the bristles). 35.Purchase eco-friendly toilet paper.Recycled toilet paper or reusable cloth squares are sustainable alternatives to paper toilet paper.  36.Replace your shower head.Showering accounts for nearly 17% of residential indoor water use.Similar to ENERGY STAR, the EPA has created a WaterSense label to identify water-efficient products.Switching to one could save the average family 2,700 gallons of water per year. 37.Opt for reusable cotton pads.Most makeup remover wipes are made from synthetic materials and harmful microplastics that are detrimental to marine life when they are broken down (and your skin for that matter.)  38.Place a recycling bin in the bathroom.You are much more likely to recycle when the bin is easily accessible.  39.Choose conscious cosmetics.You should worry both about the packaging and ingredients to avoid in skincare, both of which are bad for you and the planet.Instead, look for products that utilize natural skincare ingredients products.  40.Say no to (or opt for sustainably-sourced) palm oil.Palm oil is a major driver of deforestation and exploitation as well as air pollution, water pollution, and biodiversity loss—and it’s found in everything from toothpaste and shampoo to peanut butter. 41. Use a menstrual cup.In a lifetime, a single person who menstruates is expected to throw away around 400 pounds of period product packaging.Menstrual cups are completely hygienic and are a low-waste replacement for single use pads and tampons (even organic tampons). 42. Follow ecological gardening tips.Like planting native species.Without native plants, insects and birds that have co-evolved with them cannot survive.Planting native plant species can combat climate change, encourage water conservation, and increase biodiversity—which is just about the best summer and spring sustainability tip we can offer. 43.Plant pollinator friendly plants.Almost 80% of our food and industrial products require pollination by animals.By protecting pollinator species, we can help our air, water, and soil stay healthy.Common pollinator-friendly plants include bee balm, echinacea, and so many others, which you can look up based on your region. 44.Ditch the herbicides.The chemicals in herbicides can cause habitat alteration that affects the species living in these habitats.Look into natural alternatives to kill weeds, such as mulching your lawn, laying down glass panes for several weeks to burn them away before planting your garden, or hand-weeding once you have. 45.Master the art of companion planting.Companion planting is the strategic planting of certain crops in proximity to each other (and keeping others far apart) for any number of reasons—like increasing soil nutrients, chasing away bugs and pests (so you don’t have to buy natural bug spray), and maximizing the efficiency of your garden. 46.You need the Neem.Neem oil is an organic insect repellent and fungal cure that is practically non-toxic to the environment, except in huge doses.Other chemical-free ways to rid your garden of unwanted insects include Diatomaceous Earth (food-grade, OMRI-tested) or planting herbs around perimeters. 47.Switch your sprinklers.Rotary nozzles fit on most popup spray heads.Rotating nozzles deliver water slower with larger droplets, reducing both runoff and water waste.  48.Stop sprinkling altogether.Take the previous summer sustainability tip to the next level and don’t sprinkle at all.Landscape irrigation accounts for ⅓ of all residential water use in the U.S. (or 9 billion gallons per day).Reserve some water for your vegetables, but opt for drought-resistant landscaping plants or rock gardens. 49.Dispose of yard waste properly.Many municipalities have free composting centers for yard waste like branches, leaves, and grass trimmings.Garden waste can be turned into soil conditioner, a product used for agriculture and land reclamation to increase soil condition.  50.Look into rainscaping.Stormwater runoff picks pollutants from fertilizers and pesticides as it travels through storm drains into rivers, oceans, and lakes.Rainscaping uses the landscape to naturally redirect and reuse stormwater runoff to reduce the amount of water pollution happening. 51.Leave the leaves.If you’re looking for the best sustainability tips for fall, here it is.Fallen leaves break down to create nutrient rich soil and keep our insect friends happy by providing shelter and insulation during the colder months. 52.Adopt a minimalist mindset.The L.A. Times has reported that the average U.S. household has 300,000 things in it.We’d hazard a guess that you can’t even name that many things you use.By consuming less resources, you can reduce the amount of waste being created—making this perhaps #1 among tips for sustainable living. 53.Adopt a capsule wardrobe.Capsule wardrobes are typically made of 30 to 50 articles of clothing that can be used interchangeably for a number of occasions.You’d be surprised how many outfits you can create with a minimalist wardrobe.  54.Looking for sustainable spring cleaning tips?Donate or upcycle what you don’t want.The recycling rate of all textiles, including furniture and clothing, is only 15%.It can be tempting to throw old clutter away, but donating used items can give someone else a chance to love them.There are tons of places to recycle old clothes and an equally infinite number of ways to upcycle them. 55.Become a borrower.Renting and borrowing items instead of buying them can reduce the amount of personal items that end up in the landfill.With increasing numbers of toy libraries, tool libraries, and online clothing rental services, this is easier than ever. 56.Repair rather than replace.This can apply to everything from clothing to technology.If you’re not handy with a sewing machine and don’t have a local tailor in your area, there are plenty of online clothes repair services looking to revive your worn-out wardrobe.For non-textiles, look into local repair workshops.  57.Shop second hand.Landfills receive around 11 tons of textile waste per year.Local or online thrift shopping can give a second chance to the clothes that would otherwise be a part of this statistic. 58.Invest in reusable bags (including produce bags).Here’s an OG among sustainability practices examples, but that’s for good reason.Americans use more than 100 billion plastic bags each year.Reusable bags are more durable than plastic bags and can help you express your personal style.Extra points if you make them yourself or use bags you already own.  59.Buy in bulk.Grocery stores with bulk bins eliminate the need for fancy packaging and single-use plastics.If you prefer doing your shopping online, these online bulk stores might be for you.  60.Shop at zero waste stores.These offer low-waste and compostable packaging options for food, beauty products, and cleaning products.Like with the bulk stores, there are a number of zero waste online shopping options.  61.Online shopping with slower, grouped delivery.A traditional shopper has almost twice the carbon emissions as an online shopper.While ethical online shopping can cut carbon emissions, rushed delivery can break the benefit of shopping online due to more delivery trucks and packaging.  62.Choose quality over quantity.Ah, the most classic (and our favorite) sustainable shopping tip.It may be tempting to purchase cheaper options, but products made of quality, sustainable fabrics and materials are both more ethical and last longer. 63.Choose slow fashion.Dyeing and finishing are responsible for 3% of global CO2 emissions and over 20% of global water pollution—which is why fast fashion has become a rising problem due to the turnover rate of trendy pieces. 64.Buy a bike for shorter commutes.Some of the best tips for a sustainable office start with how you get there, after all.​​Just moderate increases in bicycle use each year could save an estimated 6 to 14 million tons of CO2. 65.Use public transportation.Leaving your car at home and opting for public transportation could reduce annual CO2 emissions by 20 pounds per day.  66.Take a walk.Walking is not only better for the environment, but also for your mental and physical health.  67.Invest in an electric vehicle.If you have the means to do so, electric vehicles are the way to go (literally).They have fewer greenhouse gas emissions than petrol or diesel cars do and don’t support the oil industry.However, be aware that they are still a vehicle with parts (including extremely hard-to-recycle batteries) that break and need replacing, so they aren’t devoid of impact themselves. 68.Miss your flight.Trains can cut your CO2 emissions by half when compared to flight, which are responsible for 12% of all CO2 emissions from transport. 69.Choose sustainable travel tours offered by eco-tourism companies who support conservation and sustainable travel while supporting the local economy. 70.Invest in travel-friendly products.Staying stocked up with reusable cutlery, water bottles, and takeaway utensils can help reduce plastic usage, whether abroad or simply at a company lunch.  71.Offset your carbon.Sometimes the only option is catching a flight.Luckily, there are a number of carbon offset programs that make it easy to reduce your carbon footprint while flying. 72.Use portable solar panels.Solar power banks are environmentally-friendly and convenient during long trips where outlets may not be available. 73.Swap to reusable cloths or other eco-friendly diapers.Disposable diapers are the third largest single consumer item in landfills, representing around 4% of solid waste.  74.Choose to breastfeed if you are able.The carbon footprint and environmental impact of four months of exclusive feeding with infant formula is 35% to 72% higher than four months of exclusive breastfeeding.With no need for packaging, heating, or transportation, breastfeeding is as sustainable as it gets. 75.Ditch the plastic bottles.When it comes to baby bottles, glass bottles take the cake over plastic bottles because they do not leach chemicals and are easier to repurpose.  76.Make your own baby food.Supplementing your baby’s diet with homemade food lets you control both the ingredients and amount of plastic you use—but make sure you talk to your child’s pediatrician to ensure you know their needs.  77.Invest in eco-friendly toys.Research finds that 25% of children’s toys contain harmful chemicals that are both toxic to children and the environment.Those made from natural materials such as wood or bamboo are much better for everyone involved.  78.Ditch baby wipes.Wet wipes do not degrade before reaching the sewer and are often ingested by sea creatures looking for their next meal.Environmental impacts of bio-based eco-friendly baby wipes are 38% lower than petroleum-based wipes. 79.Get them hooked on sustainability early.One of the most sustainable things to do at home is passing on a sense of responsibility for this wonderful world we inhabit.Sustainability for kids can be as easy as reading The Lorax at bedtime or as full-on as letting them help with your garden. 80.Use eco-friendly cat litter.Wheat-based, walnut-based, and wood-based cat litters are great alternatives to clay or silica-based litter, which is not biodegradable.  81.Choose sustainable pet toys.Eco-friendly dog toys made from natural materials (like rice husk, rubber, and hemp) or recycled materials (like old t-shirts) are safer options than those made from plastic. 82.Pick up poo in biodegradable waste bags.These can dissolve in water in as quickly as three months, meaning they won’t build up in landfills like their plastic counterparts.  83.“Adopt Don’t Shop”.According to the ASPCA, 6.3 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide with approximately 920,000 of them ending up euthanized.By choosing adoption over breeding, you are reducing the resources needed to feed another animal.  84.Keep pets indoors.Outdoor cats are opportunistic hunters, making them a huge threat to local wildlife biodiversity.Free-ranging domestic cats kill up to 4 billion birds and 22.3 billion mammals annually.  85.Get pets spay/neutered.Spaying and neutering are important methods for population control, reducing the amount of resources needed to support the population. 86.Shop for sustainable dog food and eco-friendly cat food.This can help reduce the carbon footprint associated with pet food production, which includes around 106 million tons of CO2. 87.Use recycled and eco-friendly wrapping paper materials.The best Christmas sustainability tips are those that prevent the 2.3 million pounds of wrapping paper ending up in landfills annually.Old newspapers and thrifted wicker baskets are some options for zero waste gift wrapping. 88.Invest in LED Christmas lights.LED lights are 80% more energy-efficient, emitting brighter light so you can save energy all season long. 89.Recycle your eco Christmas tree.Most towns have tree recycling centers, but you could also recycle it yourself by turning the pine needles into mulch and using the trunks for firewood.  90.Send a seed-filled card.Let’s be honest, how many of us actually save Christmas cards?If Christmas-cards are a must, support pollinators by choosing plantable paper embedded with wildflower seeds. 91.Gift an experience.The holiday season produces an extra 25 million tons of garbage a year, meaning the most zero waste gifts are those that don’t involve a physical gift at all. 92.Create your own DIY decor.Ditch that plastic tinsel and create your own garland from pine cones instead.If you don’t have time, opt for other sustainable-made options like eco-friendly Christmas crackers and reusable advent calendars. 93.Prepare an eco-friendly feast.During Thanksgiving sustainability tips are critical because Americans produce 305 million pounds of food waste during this food-filled festival.Planning a menu and portioning ingredients ahead of time is one of the best food waste solutions.  94.Participate in a gift swap.Get rid of something old and replace it with something new-to-you rather than just purchasing new items.You can use this sustainability tip for Christmas, birthdays, and more. 95.Opt for homemade sustainable stocking stuffers.Freshly baked goods and other home-made goodies are a better alternative to mass-produced store-bought stocking stuffers.  96.Stay warm by cuddling up under the mistletoe.Lowering your thermostat during winter and raising it during summer can cause significant decreases in energy usage, effectively lowering your carbon footprint.  97.Shop mindfully.Purchase ethical gifts that are practical and likely to be used more than once.Better still if they provide ways to be more sustainable for the recipient, too, like a zero-waste starter kit or compost bin.  98.Use natural candles.Normal candles are filled with synthetic scents, petroleum wax, and lead wicks that don’t always burn clean.Sustainable candles made from natural waxes are far less harmful when burned. 99.Give that Jack O’Lantern a second chance.Pumpkin waste is more frightful than the holiday itself, with 900,000 tons thrown away each year in the US alone.Scare that waste away with Halloween sustainability tips.When carving, roast the seeds and make soup with the other “guts”.For the drooping face, be sure to compost it or give it to local farmers to feed to their livestock. 100.Volunteer for local organizations.By joining in on a local beach clean up or helping at the community garden, you can contribute to a healthier community.Plus, you get to set an example of sustainability to inspire those around you. 101.Donate your money.Donating to a worthy cause can help fund environmental research and conservation work.Look into nonprofits that combat important conservation topics like climate change and biodiversity loss—like some of the nonprofits we donate to through 1% For the Planet. We cover the latest in sustainable living, fashion, zero waste, beauty, travel, finance and more… We hope these eco-friendly living tips help you see how simple it is to adopt a more sustainable way of living  We want to emphasize that sustainable living is not about perfection.There is no perfect solution to the problem, only imperfect attempts to reduce our carbon footprint little by little.Small actions make huge differences.

Let’s talk about low waste living.  No, this won’t require you to fit all of your trash into a single mason jar. Nor will you have to restock every room in your house with zero waste products. Instead, the low waste lifestyle embraces some of the practices of zero waste, while realizing that we’re all human and being truly zero waste is rarely, if ever, possible. Luckily for us, the impossibility of zero waste can be remedied by the approachability of low waste.  Many of us have become familiar with the five Rs of zero waste, and while the low waste approach recognizes another R (reality), we can still use the original five to help us produce less waste.They are:  We can even add another R: repair.  Aside from the obvious repairs like darning your socks or replacing a missing button, the recent implementation of Europe’s “right to repair” laws means manufacturers of electronic goods will have to ensure that their products are repairable for seven to ten years. This means that the culture of repair should hopefully become more accessible in the future.  While it might take some time to become mainstream, in the meantime, we can focus predominantly on the other five Rs.  How do we do this? By adopting one (or more) low waste living hacks.But if you’re looking for even more ways to dial down your impact, check out our favorite zero waste tips.  This is the bread and butter of a low waste society.  There are many sustainability books and zero waste books that highlight the why and how of minimalism, but essentially it comes down to this: only consume what you really, really, really need.  Instead of making impulse purchases, take a slower approach to your consumption.Wait a week, a month, or a year and if you still need something, find a way to source it sustainably. You’ll end up with less stuff and your life will be richer for it. In addition to aiming for low waste packaging, you can also up your recycling game.  This starts with realizing that you may be someone who practices wishcycling, or aspirational recycling – the mere hope that anything and everything can be recycled.  Improper recycling means that even more resources are required to transport non-recyclables to landfills (read: much worse than just trashing it in the first place).  It’s hard to be perfect, but being familiar with the 7 types of plastic is a good place to start becoming a pro-recycler.  The good news is that recycling contamination is increasingly being recognized as a big problem.The EPA, for example, has outlined how they plan to improve education and support in the U.S. as part of their National Recycling Strategy.  By reducing the amount of food waste that gets sent to the landfill (estimated by the EPA to be 21.6% of all solid waste), we’re not only reducing the load on ever-expanding landfills, but we’re also minimizing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that’s 25x more potent than CO2.  Fortunately, composting, even apartment composting, has the potential to reduce the environmental footprint of food waste while creating a valuable resource for your garden.  Start by learning about what you can compost, as well as what’s not compostable.Then, equip your kitchen with an indoor compost bin and get ready to see the benefits of composting for yourself. Low waste swaps don’t have to be complex or costly.If you’re dipping your toes into low waste living, consider these easy zero waste swaps: Other items in your zero waste kit might include a bamboo toothbrush, reusable utensils, and food storage containers (many of which can come in the form of upcycled glass food jars).  How can we be low waste in the kitchen?  A low waste kitchen needs to be low waste in terms of both food and packaging. With a little planning ahead and mindful shopping, you can ensure that everything you buy gets prepared and eaten without ending up in the trash. Bulk cooking a recipe and then freezing portions for later, as well as eating some leftovers for lunch the next day, are some of the most effective ways of doing this.   Targeting packaging can start with those upcycled glass jars we just mentioned.But it can go much further by using a range of plastic free food storage containers and learning how to freeze meat without plastic. You may also like to take a look at how often you’re relying on single servings and individually-wrapped snacks.  Choose some zero waste kitchen ideas to try out and if you’re keen to go one step further, learn how to preserve food at home.   Low waste grocery shopping has become much easier in recent years.  More low waste and bulk stores have been popping up all around the globe, offering a range of beauty and body care products, food, kitchen and cleaning essentials.   If they haven’t made it to your part of the world yet, zero waste online shops and online bulk stores can help you get the products you love without all the packaging. If that’s still not an option, consider buying as large a package as possible, or opt for easily recyclable/reusable packaging (like glass). If you aren’t ready to try “no poo” or ditch deodorant, don’t worry, the low waste approach can still make use of some of your favorite beauty products.  However, when looking for low waste beauty products, be sure to choose options with packaging that can ideally be returned, composted, or at the very least recycled (plastic #1 and #2). As a good rule of thumb, bars are better than bottles.  Be aware that many Material Recycling Facilities (MRFs) can’t accept most beauty product packaging as it’s small enough to get caught in machines or is made with mixed materials. A Real Simple article highlighted many of the beauty products that aren’t recyclable: Fortunately, many zero waste makeup and sustainable beauty brands recognize this and use compostable or refillable packaging instead, making it easy to find things like low waste skincare, low waste toothpaste, low waste shampoo, and low waste deodorant.  Zero waste cleaning is much easier than you might think.  In fact, most of your kitchen and bathroom dirt and grime can be tackled with a few simple ingredients: white vinegar, baking soda and citrus peels for scent. Old T-shirts make for excellent scrubbers, too.   If you don’t want to go the DIY route, there are several eco friendly cleaning products that make use of compostable packaging and refilling the norm, providing options for things like low waste dish soap, and low waste laundry detergent.   Low waste fashion entails taking a slow fashion approach to what’s in your wardrobe.  It means, as consumers, we should shift away from the industry’s urges to consume, consume, consume, and instead make what we currently wear last longer.  This means sourcing as much as we can secondhand, prioritizing durability, and using appropriate laundry practices and repairs to keep clothes in circulation for longer.  When new duds are necessary, a mindful approach to fashion can also mean supporting zero waste fashion brands who employ low waste practices. Like using deadstock or fabric waste, small-scale production, and circular programs for recycling old garments. Between planned obsolescence and the constant release of “new and improved” models, the technology and electronics industry is notoriously wasteful.  As the fastest growing solid waste stream in the U.S., it is more important than ever that we use electronic devices for their full lifespan and choose secondhand or refurbished options when they really need replacing. When it comes to low waste products that satisfy the needs of our tech-driven world, a small but growing number of ethical electronics brands have started using better quality materials that last longer. Regardless, until our homes are filled with sustainable technology and low waste electronics, it is important to know how to dispose of electronics correctly.  Many communities have e-waste collection sites and often thrift stores will accept electronics to be resold or recycled.  Lastly, many electronics contain heavy metals that are toxic to the environment and to people handling them and need to be disposed of carefully. Check the legislation for your region before disposing of any electronic devices.  There’s no sweeping the issue of furniture waste under the rug.It’s a big problem, with Americans throwing away an average of 12 million tons of furniture every year, almost all of it ending up in landfills.   Less is more when it comes to a low waste home.This means showing some restraint when the interior designer in you wants to make constant changes.It also means repairing and updating old furniture instead of purchasing something new.  When you do need furniture or home decor pieces, secondhand options should be the first choice.  If second hand isn’t an option, look to sustainable furniture brands that, in some cases, use upcycled materials or have recycling programs available. Similarly, vintage home decor and sustainable home decor brands can provide maximum style with minimum impact.  With all the talk surrounding zero waste, it’s important to remember its kinder, less-demanding relative: low waste.  If we think of it as a spectrum, zero waste is intended to be, well… zero.Low waste is up to interpretation, making it more attainable for those of us who don’t have the time or resources to learn how to sew our own clothes or stop at three different bulk shops every week.  Low waste living means that you make changes to your lifestyle where they are possible and sustainable for you to maintain personally, without placing yourself under the pressure of perfectionism.  Ultimately, more people choosing a low waste lifestyle has got to be better than a few people living zero waste and everyone else being too overwhelmed to try, right? Think of low waste as zero waste, with a little love blended in.  Not only is it more approachable, but it corrects for some of the failures brought on by the zero waste movement.Consider this: If you feel like the zero waste movement swept up all of your favorite Instagram influencers and left you in the dust, you’re not alone.  The low waste movement shows us that sustainability doesn’t need to be an all or nothing affair.Any (and all) steps in the right direction are critical to the health of our planet. If this has turned you into a lover of low waste living, consider sharing it with a friend or family member for a planet-friendly pick me up!

Each day, Americans discard 4.9 pounds of trash per person.That’s almost 1,800 pounds per year.  The take-make-waste economy is responsible for vast amounts of GHG emissions, water pollution, and land pollution.  While there are many zero waste solutions to these problems, we’re here to help you get started on the right eco foot(print) with some zero waste tips for beginners.  Before we (dumpster) dive in, here’s’ a quick refresher on the 5 Rs of zero waste living from Bea Johnson of Zero Waste Home: And remember: zero waste is a journey, not a destination, and it’s all about the difference you can make along the way.  Not all zero waste ideas will work for everyone, and that’s okay.Start small and add in new steps when you can.‘Progress, not perfection’, we like to say.We’re all learning as we go. Short-lived at best and single-use at worst, plastic consumables are piling up in landfills at staggering speeds. The easiest changes to make while going zero waste are simply refusing such items and using a longer-lasting and environmentally friendly alternative.  When you’re out and about, say no to: There are so many refusals to get you on your way to a zero waste kitchen and it’s a great place to start when you’re looking for how to go zero waste at home. It sounds funny when you consider a bathroom’s most essential function is to deal with human waste, but a zero waste bathroom is totally possible through more conscious shopping and greening your daily routines. Be sure to refuse:  Some of the best practices for raising a zero waste baby call for fewer products, and refusing Is a zero waste dog, cat, or other furry friend possible?  With a few eco-swaps, you can be well on your way: A home office can create a whole bunch of unnecessary waste.Say sayonara to: For items you can’t outright refuse or avoid, try to reduce how much of them you buy or reduce the amount of waste they generate.  Packaging, and in particular food packaging, is a big one, so buy as much in bulk as possible.A zero waste pantry reduces heaps of plastic and cardboard waste.Zero Waste Home’s bulk finder app may help you locate one nearby bulk.Alternatively, there are many online zero waste stores you can use.   For fresh fruit and veg, bypass the supermarket and head to your local farmers market or organic grocery store to avoid unnecessary plastic, stickers, and ties.Don’t forget your reusable produce bags! Shop at bakeries, patisseries, and delis where you can bring your own bag or container, too, or try making these at home instead. One of the best tips for zero waste living is to adopt a minimalist mentality and stop buying stuff you don’t need. Your wardrobe is a great place to start.  Challenge yourself to buy fewer new clothes or even go so far as to  #neverbuynew.Make an adventure out of hunting down super stylish second hand duds or clothing and dress rentals. If you need to buy something new, buy only what really fits and what you absolutely love.Always choose well-made pieces from ethical clothing brands, even if they cost more (hint: there’s a reason for that). Nowadays, gadgets are designed with planned obsolescence in mind, and it’s almost cheaper to buy new ones when they break.Try to break the cycle. Buy well-made, warranty-backed items, and if something happens, repair them; don’t replace them.We call this our “slow tech philosophy.” If you need to replace, buy secondhand if you can, and make sure you properly dispose of old electronics. Ask for a donation or an experience gift that doesn’t cost the earth (e.g., dinner for two or tickets to a movie or sporting event).  If giving a gift, employ the same philosophy. If you buy material gifts (ideally zero waste gifts or general eco-friendly gifts) make sure the recipient will definitely use them.  Reusing is a brilliant way to reduce waste (and save you money!).   While we’ve included reusable product suggestions throughout this list to help you avoid using disposable items, we ALWAYS advocate for using what you already have before buying new.  Jars are the zero waster’s best friend and one of the best plastic-free food storage containers.Use them to stock up on bulk goods and store prepared meals and snacks.  Their non-food uses are limitless, too, from candle holders and flower vases to pen holders and craft supply storage.  Keeping items in use for as long as possible is one of the best ways to create a waste-free life.  Whether we’re talking clothing or home decor, you don’t need to buy new to achieve a fresh look.Getting busy with creative repurposing is key to living waste-free.  From popping tags at your local thrift store to snagging an eBay bargain, there’s no shortage of options for secondhand shopping.  Collating a secondhand wardrobe is one of the best ways to avoid fast fashion.From vintage to designer, there are pre-loved bargains galore for every sustainable fashionista. But thrifting isn’t limited to just clothes.Save the trees by buying secondhand wooden furniture or items made from reclaimed wood.Well-made wooden furniture lasts decades, and plenty of pieces are waiting to be rehomed. Don’t forget the matching kitschy decor to go with it! One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.Even if you don’t have a use for something, someone else might.  Donate your unwanted items to charity or thrift stores, or find someone who wants them on sites like Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Freecycle. For old clothes that are still in good condition, consider platforms such as thredUP, Poshmark, and Depop.You can earn extra money while ensuring your clothes go to someone who’ll wear them. Many of our favorite circular economy companies, including Patagonia and Mud Jeans, support circular fashion with take-back schemes and pre-loved programs.You’ll often receive store credit for trading in your old items.  Reserve recycling for items that can’t be refused, reduced, or reused.  While there will inevitably be some items you need to recycle, try only to buy items that come in easy-to-recycle packaging, like cardboard, glass, and aluminum.  Some types of plastic are more difficult to recycle than others.Check your local recycling rules if unsure. Local recycling rules differ, so make sure you know what they are to maximize the amount of waste that actually gets recycled.  Guidelines about what can and can’t be recycled and how items should be sorted can generally be found on council/municipality websites.  Sometimes, contamination is due to “wish-cycling,” putting an item in the recycling bin and hoping it will be recycled.It’s important to avoid such recycling contamination, as it could mean that an entire lorry load of recycling is rejected and has to be landfilled or incinerated instead. If in doubt, leave it out. Some categories of items are easier to recycle than others.There are plenty of options for where to recycle old clothes, for example.   Before you throw something in the trash, pause for a second.A surprising number of items can be recycled at specialized facilities.  For everything else, rot (aka compost) it! Humans throw away a staggering amount of organic, compostable waste—over 60% of waste output in the US.  The word “rot” may not sound exciting, but the benefits of composting are huge, and everyone can do it.You can do it in your yard, on your balcony, or even indoors, thanks to some very clever indoor compost bins.  With a little bit of know-how, composting is a straightforward process.We recommend you start by learning what is compostable and what’s not compostable and take it from there.  Food waste accounts for 8% of global GHG emissions.  Reducing is the first step.Learn how to keep produce fresh and preserve food.  Next, learn how to reuse scraps, such as turning vegetable scraps into stock and citrus peels into a homemade cleaner. With any food waste you can’t reuse, it’s time to make compost.Collect food waste in a repurposed container and either compost it at home or check with your local council to see if they offer a food waste collection service. If not, check the ShareWaste App (which connects composters with folks wanting to get rid of their food waste) or places like Craigslist, Facebook, farmer’s markets, or community gardens to find people willing to put your scraps to good use. Use your nutrient-rich compost to grow your very own sustainable garden. Perfect for amending soil and providing nutrients to plants, you can use your homemade compost to grow fresh herbs, salad greens, and all manner of vegetables, putting you well on your way to living waste-free.  We cover the latest in sustainable living, fashion, zero waste, beauty, travel, finance and more… these are such great ideas!I seriously never even considered bringing my own containers to take leftovers home from a restaurant! I can only suggest, glass straws, they are unbelievable and strong.Special glass that is child safe.http://www.strawhopper.com .Love your site. Thank you for providing a deeper dive into no-waste!It was helpful to see some new ideas.

How air pollution is destroying our health As the world gets hotter and more crowded, our engines continue to pump out dirty emissions, and half the world has no access to clean fuels or technologies (e.g. stoves, lamps), the very air we breathe is growing dangerously polluted: nine out of ten people now breathe polluted air, which kills 7 million people every year.The health effects of air pollution are serious – one third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution.This is having an equivalent effect to that of smoking tobacco, and much higher than, say, the effects of eating too much salt.  Facebook live: special talk on climate change with Arnold Schwarzenegger News release: More than 90% of children breathe toxic air WHO report: Air pollution and child health: prescribing clean air Share The lack of visible smog is no indication that the air is healthy.Across the world, both cities and villages are seeing toxic pollutants in the air exceed the average annual values recommended by WHO’s air quality guidelines.To help people better understand just how polluted the air is where they live, the WHO, UN Environment and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition’s Breathe Life campaign developed an  online pollution meter. This year, WHO and partners are convening the first   Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health in Geneva on 29 October – 1 November to rally the world towards major commitments to fight this problem.The conference will raise awareness of this growing public health challenge and share information and tools on the health risks of air pollution and its interventions. Video: How air pollution impacts your body First WHO Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health How dirty is the air where you live? This conference will showcase some of WHO’s work on air pollution, including the findings of its Global Platform on Air Quality and Health.This platform whose diverse membership includes researchers, civil society, UN agencies and other partner institutions reviews the data on air quality and health.For example, the platform is working on techniques to more accurately attribute air pollution coming from different sources of pollution.It is also working on improving estimates of air quality by combining the data from various air quality monitoring networks, atmospheric modelling and satellite remote sensing. Critical issues at the first Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health Air quality monitoring →  Air quality monitoring in low- and middle-income countries needs to be strengthened, especially in areas close to hospitals, schools, and workplaces.Low-cost sensors and other new technologies can expand air quality monitoring and forecasting to areas that are currently underserved.New protocols and standards are needed to guide the effective use and interpretation of data produced by low-cost sensors in citizen science and other applications. Flickr/Leniners Health sector emissions →  Access to reliable and sustainable energy in healthcare facilities is essential to achieve the goal of universal health coverage.On-site renewable energy generation in healthcare facilities can improve access to healthcare services, especially in rural, developing world settings.In developed countries, hospitals are among the most energy-intensive buildings.By reducing its own carbon footprint, the health sector can show how climate change mitigation produces concrete health benefits.   Equipping national health workforces →  National health workforces must be capable of dealing with the immediate impacts of air pollution on the health of populations, and to inform policymakers to undertake preventive action to reduce the air pollution-related disease burden.There are currently few training programmes on air pollution and its health effects, and little related information, in public health education.   Children’s health →  Globally, 93% of children under 18 live with air pollution levels above WHO guidelines.Air pollution causes over half of all child deaths from acute lower respiratory infection in children under 5 years in lower middle income countries.Air pollution exposure is linked to a wide range of adverse health outcomes in children, including infant mortality, asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders, and childhood cancers.By “prescribing” clean air for children, policymakers can protect them from the lifelong effects of air pollution exposure. Unspash/Robert Collins Access to clean household energy →  Clean household energy access must move higher on the global energy, health and climate agendas.Household air pollution  is one of the world’s single biggest environmental health risk, and a significant source of climate-warming pollution.To achieve SDG 7 targets for universal access to modern energy, 3 billion people must gain access to clean cooking solutions, and 1 billion must gain access to electricity, by 2030.  The current pace of progress mains too slow.  Unsplash/Joshua Newton Climate change →   Air pollution is the greatest environmental risk to health of our time, and climate change is the greatest public health threat of the 21st century.Burning fossil fuels is the primary source of both climate-warming emissions and health-damaging air pollution.Reducing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants can generate immediate benefits for health and slow climate change Actions to reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and short-lived climate pollutants are also measures to protect public health now and in the future. Unsplash/Thomas Hafeneth Noncommunicable diseases →   Air pollution is the second leading cause of noncommunicable diseases, such as stroke, cancer and heart disease, which are on the rise worldwide.In many countries, such diseases can only be significantly reduced by improving air quality.Mainstreaming air pollution reduction into policies to combat noncommunicable diseases leads to multiple benefits for the environment, economy and health.  Outdoor workers → Outdoor workers, including agricultural, construction or waste collection workers, and traffic police, are particularly vulnerable to ambient air pollution; at least 1.2 billion people work outdoors most of the time.In addition to breathing polluted air, such workers are often exposed to other environmental risks, such as heat and cold, heavy rain, and wind as well as solar UV and allergenic pollens.   There are two main types of air pollution –  ambient air pollution (outdoor pollution) and household (or indoor) air pollution refers to pollution generated by household combustion of fuels (caused by burning fuel such as coal, wood or kerosene) using open fires or basic stoves in poorly ventilated spaces.Both indoor and outdoor air pollution can contribute to each other, as air moves from inside buildings to the outside, and vice versa.   Report: Burning Opportunity - Clean Household Energy Factsheet: Outdoor air quality and health Household air pollution kills 4 million people a year and tends to affect countries in Africa and Asia, where polluting fuels and technologies are used every day particularly at home for cooking, heating and lighting.Women and children, who tend to spend more time indoors, are affected the most.  The main pollutants: are (1) particulate matter, a mix of solid and liquid droplets arising mainly from fuel combustion and road traffic; (2) nitrogen dioxide from road traffic or indoor gas cookers; (3) sulphur dioxide from burning fossil fuels; and (4) ozone at ground level, caused by the reaction of sunlight with pollutants from vehicle emissions.The pollutant that affects people the most is particulate matter (often abbreviated to PM and used as a measure for air pollution). 5 ways to limit breathing polluted air 1. Limit walking on busy streets during rush hour – and if you have a young child with you, try to lift them up above the level of vehicle exhausts 2. Limit spending time at specific hotspots of traffic such as cars stopped at traffic lights 3. When you’re doing physical activity outdoors, try exercising in less polluted areas 4. Limit the use of cars in highly polluted days 5. Don’t burn waste as the smoke that results damages our health While particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less, (≤ PM10) can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs, the even more health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, (≤ PM2.5).These particles are so small that 60 of them make up the width of a human hair.  PM2.5 can penetrate the lung barrier and enter the blood system.They can increase the risk of heart and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer. Ozone is a major factor in causing asthma (or making it worse), and nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide can also cause asthma, bronchial symptoms, lung inflammation and reduced lung function. 10 Things To Know About Air Pollution Children and air pollution So how polluted can air be before it starts to affect our health?For PM2.5, WHO guidelines say the maximum safe level is an annual average concentration of 10 μg/m3 or less.To encourage cities to reduce air pollution, even if they are unable to meet the ideal safe levels, WHO has set three interim targets for cities.These are: 15 μg/m3 (interim target 3); 25 μg/m3 (interim target 2); 35 μg/m3 (interim target 1).Many cities are now exceeding the very upper level of interim target 1.   Air pollution has a disastrous effect on children.Worldwide, up to 14% of children aged 5 – 18 years have asthma relating to factors including air pollution.Every year, 543 000 children*  younger than 5 years die of respiratory disease linked to air pollution.Air pollution is also linked to childhood cancers.Pregnant women are exposed to air pollution, it can affect fetal brain growth.Air pollution is also linked to cognitive     impairment in both children and adults.*Number updated to reflect new numbers published by WHO on 29 October 2018   10 ways you can fight air pollution Video: How will our children continue to breathe? As well as affecting our health, pollutants in the air are also causing long-term environmental damage by driving climate change, itself a major threat to health and well-being.  This month, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that coal-fired electricity must end by 2050 if we are to limit global warming rises to 1.5C.If not, we may see a major climate crisis in just 20 years. The conference next week will call for urgent action, seeking agreement on a target for reducing deaths from air pollution.  WHO and partners such as UN Environment are developing ways to support countries.For example, WHO is developing a toolkit (the Clean Household Energy Solutions Toolkit, CHEST) to help countries implement WHO’s recommendations on household fuel combustion and to develop policies to expand clean household energy use.  BreatheLife – a global campaign for clean air,  headed by WHO, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, and UN Environment – is mobilizing communities to reduce the impact of air pollution in cities, regions and countries, currently reaching around 97 million people.    Facebook live: Conversation on air pollution and health Clean air interventions will be a focus of the conference.Affordable strategies exist to reduce emissions from energy, transport, waste management, housing and industrial sectors.These interventions often carry other benefits like reduced traffic and noise, increased physical activity and better land use – all of which contribute to improving health and well-being.The conference will present activities and results from the ongoing work of the  WHO’s Urban Health Initiative focused on supporting cities with the data, tools and capacity to select, implement and track ‘clean and healthy’ policies at the city level.  Better air quality will benefit all of us, everywhere.
